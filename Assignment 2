I have been lately interested in conductive ink /Electric paint. I find these 
kind of projects to be very interactive and fun to play with. So I would love to experiment with this material going forward.
But I don't want to constrain myself with this but at the same time keep myslef open to other ideas as well.
I also want to build more like a musical reminder system if possible in this class.
Which would be a convincing piece for my thesis. I am hoping to benefit the most of this class and enhance my skills over arduino.

This example that I shared is more of a custom made interactive drum surface to play with.
I was also thinking of making a 4/4 dance floor which could be aen interactive surface for people to move over and play music 
at the same time.

This could be an other example more of a painting with conductive ink. When you move an object over it you can play music.
