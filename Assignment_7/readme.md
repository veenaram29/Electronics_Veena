####Final project proposals and prototype

Build a prototype to verify the most difficult part of your project

- Research - Did research on how to build a respiratory transducer.

- Order or check out equipment - Ordered equipments


Create a very clear project description identifying the Minimal Viable Project and optional add-ons
Include flow charts, block diagrams, and pseudo-code

- Minimal Viable Project:
I am trying to make a respiratory belt sensor which will be connected to a human chest or stomach based on their breating style to detect the breathing signals and convert into waveforms.This could be detected in an application software called Lab chart. But there are application software's available in market make use of. After making this work, I would like to connect the Piezzo buzzer to the arduino board in converting those breathing signal into interactive visual from with the help of processsing. 

- Second Version: 
In the second version I want to two users to participate to breath and create organic breathing visual on screen 
User 1 - left to right (colored organic form)
User 2- righ to left (colored organic form)
When both meet (color changes into white or black or some other color based on asthetics)

- Third Version:
If this is possible then I would try to make it more advanced in connecting two users at the same time to detect their breathing pattern through two differnet repiratory belt sensors and convert their breathing pattern into beautiful visual 
form through connected LEDS. First user would send his breathing signal to the second user So I imagine the LEDS is connected between them to send signal for the other person to start breathing as the light changes into white and switch off as it lights the last LED of the connection.

By this way I believe we can encourage users to involve in a mindful breathing exercise through visual cues of their breathing pattern.
