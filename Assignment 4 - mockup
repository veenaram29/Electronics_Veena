**Mock up - Tabla Instrument**
Things I did try to do over the week researching :

Step 1 -Tabla tones:  I got them downloaded in [SampleTones](http://sampleswap.org/home/downloads.php)
(This is a good website to download tones - free of cost - Just register to download tones)

Step 2 - Used Makey Makey drum player app to test  - Bongos
http://makeymakey.com/bongos/

Step 3 - Tried Arduino to test capacitive Sensor : Piano

Step 4 - Tried FSR

Step 5 - Tried Playing tabla sounds in makey makey and SoundPlant

Question:
Is it okay to Makey makey instead of Arduino?
Can you give us some thoughts about using a "music maker Mp3 Shield"?
Some sample code to play with while using mp3 shield?
