Homework:
1.Propose a creative experimental musical instrument:

I want to play "tabla" the indian classical music instrument by using conductive ink.


A quick short description of the instrument-
The tabla is a South Asian membranophone percussion instrument consisting of a pair of 
small drums. It has been a particularly important instrument in Hindustani classical 
music since the 18th century, and remains in use in India, Pakistan, 
Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. The name tabla likely comes from tabl, the Persian 
and Arabic word for drum. 

The tabla consists of two single headed, barrel shaped small drums of slightly different size and shapes: 
daya also called dahina meaning right, and baya also called bahina meaning left. The daya tabla is 
played by the musician's right hand (dominant hand), and is about 15 centimetres (~6 in) 
in diameter and 25 centimetres (~10 in) high. The baya tabla is a bit bigger and deep kettledrum shaped, 
about 20 centimetres (~8 in) in diameter and 25 centimetres (~10 in) in height. Each is made of 
hollowed out wood or clay or brass, the daya drum laced with hoops, thongs and wooden dowels on its sides. 
The dowels and hoops are used to tighten the tension of the membrane. 
The daya is tuned to the ground note of the raga called Sa (tonic in Western music). 
The baya construction and tuning is about a fifth to an octave below that of the daya drum. 
The musician uses his hand's heel pressure to change the pitch and tone color of each drum during a performance.

1a.Draw a sketch of your instrument -

1b.Describe the overall concept - I want to use pressure or touch sensors which works the best to 
activate the sound to play my tabla through conductive ink.

2.Create a very rough schematic to the best of your ability -

3.Describe what your program will do, to the best of your ability- 
As tabla has two different drums producing two different sounds seperately.
I want to assign tones separately for those four circles.
When the user interacts with the four circles one by one each tone should get triggered.
So when this action happens simultaneoulsy it combines to create a new sound which 
resemsbles the sound from the actual table instrument.
