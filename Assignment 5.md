###Design a musical instrument exercise.
- I wanted to design a indian tabla instrument.

###Version 1 

I tried to make a table instrument using makey makey.
This experiment came out as expected. I have downloaded the free version of [Soundplant](http://soundplant.org/) soundplant 
software to add the table notes to specific keys  assigned in makey makey to play the instrument.

Table notes where downloaded from [SampleSwap](http://sampleswap.org/)
Installation of makey makey was very easy and clear to learn from their website.

So I tried to learn makey makey through playing with their prototypes first and then 
started recreating my own version.

###Version 2 

My second version of the musical instrument is by using capacitive sensors in arduino & minim example in processing.
In this experiment, I have used three capacitive sensors to create a minimum viable product for this project.
Right now the code is working and I am able to play three tabla notes. 

Arduino - Used the Capacitive sensor example code to make the sensors work.
Processing - I have used the arduinominimexample taught in class to play the tones.
