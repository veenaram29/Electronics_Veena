Homework
- Write a concept proposal for your final project which must be substantially more complex than the exercises 
we've done in class. Upload this proposal to your Github repository in a new folder called "finalProject"

Project Proposal:
- I want to build an interactive breathing machine which detects the movement of your 
 diaphragm or stomach through movement sensor belt and send visual cues along the path through 
 the connected LED's. I also want to try an other version of this through creating 
 visuals on the screen to detect using the movement belt sensor.
   
Things required:
- Flexible aluminum wire
- Neopixels LED matrix
- Movement senor belt
- Cutter, tape, etc
- Might need more stuff!
   
User testing: 
- Do a minimum viable product and test it with users.
 Based on the test module deploy with users to create interactivity and engage
 people in a heathy habit through the help of technology.

Read the Fritzing resources shown on our resources page
Create a schematic in Fritzing and then try to create a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout of that circuit. The schematic can be of any circuit you wish e.g. your musical instrument. Inclusion of Arduino is up to you. If you have no idea, create the first circuit on this page.
